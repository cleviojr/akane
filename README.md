# java version for Akane.

6 March 2018: the project is deprecated.
I do not recommend anyone to read, copy, download or learn anything from this code.
It was so much fun(and I have no regrets) to create and maintain it as it was my first OOP project and I was a beginner in programming in general. I will always remind of this version as one of the happiest times in programming for me,
If you are looking to a newer discord bot code that you can inspire yourself or learn from it, look for my python version for akane(which will be released soon).
